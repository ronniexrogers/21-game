21 (Blackjack) by Ronnie Rogers :)

I initially set out to make this game not text based, but it turned out to be a bit more challenging than I initially anticipated. So, for the time being, the game will be text based with visuals added later on.

I set out to create a web based Blackjack game because Blackjack is my personal favorite casino game and I'm already familiar with how it is played.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

Technologies used in this project were Javascript, CSS, and HTML5.  I wanted to keep my first project simple.

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

I had a lot of fun coding my first game and playing around with this project.

Future features that I will be adding in the future include:
-Visual cards displayed rather than having the number value of the cards displayed
-A betting system that will take place over the score system
-Greater visual effects, especially when it comes time to display physical cards
-Ability to add multiple players and play locally
