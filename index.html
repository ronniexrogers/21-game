        <ul>
            <li>Each player starts out with two cards.</li>
            <li>In this game, it is player vs dealer.</li>
            <li>The objective is to get your total cards value as close to 21 without going over.</li>
            <li>If you'd like an additional card, press "Hit me!"</li>
            <li>If your total cards value is greater than 21, you automatically lose.</li>
            <li>If you don't want anymore cards, press "Stand."</li>
            <li>After you stand, the dealer will reveal their cards.</li>
            <li>If the dealer's initial total is less than 17, they keep drawing until their total is greater than 17.</li>
            <li>If the dealer's total cards value is greater than 21, you win!</li>
            <li>If the dealer's total is the same as your total, it's a draw!</li>
